The journey of e-Governance initiatives in India took a broader dimension in mid 90s for wider sectoral applications with
 emphasis on citizen-centric services. Later on, many States/UTs started various e-Governance projects. Though these e-Governance 
 projects were citizen-centric, they could make lesser than the desired impact. Government of India launched National 
 e-Governance Plan (NeGP) in 2006. 31 Mission Mode Projects covering various domains were initiated. Despite the successful 
 implementation of many e-Governance projects across the country, e-Governance as a whole has not been able to make the desired 
 impact and fulfil all its objectives. 

<P>It has been felt that a lot more thrust is required to ensure e-Governance in the country promote inclusive growth that covers 
electronic services, products, devices and job opportunities. Moreover, electronic manufacturing in the country needs to be strengthened. 

<P>In order to transform the entire ecosystem of public services through the use of information technology, the Government 
of India has launched the Digital India programme with the vision to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy.
